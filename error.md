# Project Requirements

## General Requirements
- Ensure the SIAM logo in the navbar animates correctly.
- Ensure the cross and toggle button remain in the same position.
- Ensure the menu layout changes immediately to `flex-row` when toggled, not just when the toggle is active.

## Home Page
- Add a ticker animation with a good design. (Refer to examples for responsiveness.)

## Report Page
- Implement a card flip effect with a description.
- Integrate the Report page such that it can be accessed via the 'View Report' button on the Events page.

## Events Page
- Update the Events page UI using `src/Assets/Images/future_events_template.png`.
